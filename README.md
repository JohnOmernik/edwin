## Enhancing Datascience with iPython Notebooks

Edwin is a framework of helpful scripts you can utilize in data science applications in iPython notebooks. The goal is help keep the flow of data science work in one place. No moving data to a different system to do visualizations, no exporting/importing of datato  move from big data, to small data, to graph data, etc.  

Data science is an investation and data can be anything from images, video, audio, structed, unstructored, code etc.  When we are researching, we want to try to keep information in one place not only to help ourselves as Data Scientists, but to help others who may have to quickly learn or pick up the work later.  

iPython notebooks was choosen due to it's flexibility. There are a number of commercial and even opersource tools on the market desinged to help people do parts of this, however, the idea is to gui-wrap data, that is not goal here, it's part of the result, but not the goal.  The goal here is to make research simple and intuitive. Allowing customization of tools that can produce a repeatable "enviroment" while still allowing easy customization for each users individual enviroment.
